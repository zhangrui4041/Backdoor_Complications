"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell. Sounds counter intuitive, but that's just because writing it out in words introduces imprecisions.",Physics

"Start simple. \n\nModelling things like this usually involves calculating the result numerically because the analytic results can get out of hand quickly. \n\nThe simplest numerical method is finite difference on a regular grid - you're essentially sampling the field at the grid points. Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.",Physics

"60 applications with 2 interviews is a very low success rate. There may be something systematic on your end that you're doing/not doing over your qualifications. A good CV and cover letter is an art, ideally you tailor each one to the job you are applying for.\n\nHiring managers can easily filter people out by who's paid attention when sending out CVs, the less generic the better, it's all about being memorable.\n\nMy advice, pick about 8 jobs you actually like, not just ""I'm applying because I need a job and have skills in chem"". Put the time and effort in to rewrite your CV, making sure to include key words listed on the job posting. Make sure to emphasise (key skill they are looking for) from X experience under the relevant experience. So before they call you to interview they don't have to spend any time thinking about whether your experience is relevant. Assume that the hiring manager is overworked. When you are done, you have EXACTLY 1 MINUTE to read your CV and decide whether you are a good candidate for the role. Best thing you can do is give the selection criteria to a friend and time how quickly they can tick off the key things the hiring people are looking for. (This is a true anecdote from a friend who does hiring for their company). \n\nMost people will filter you out at selection if you don't meet their entry criteria.

"Yup, I think this might be the best observation. There are some megataxonomies of viruses that emerged prior to LUCA, and their genomes also work with the standard twenty amino acids. So, while observing that both archaea and bacteria use all twenty may show that at least LUCA used these twenty amino acids, that all viruses also use them suggests a far more primitive, probably pre-cellular adoption to the twenty amino acids.\n\nSomeone could argue that it's possible that all megataxonomies of viruses only adopted the standard twenty after LUCA and only later evolved towards the current system as a result of evolution. So, while it seems quite implausible, the argument may go that it is at least *possible* this doesn't prove viruses indicate an earlier origins of the twenty amino acids than LUCA. But it turns out that LUCAs own genome is filled with viruses that used the standard twenty amino acids. So LUCAs own virome helps confirm an earlier origins of the twenty.

"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x).

"It really depends on the laws of your country. In a couple of countries (the Netherlands, Portugal, Czech republic, Switzerland) is not illegal to consume any kind of methamphetamine for personal use, regardless on the reason why you are using it. But usually at least some methylamphetamines are categorized as controlled substances and altough consumption might not be per se illegal, possession and sale surely are. There are also several methamphetamines which are perfectly legal in almost all countries and which you can buy in any pharmacy as OTC pharmaceuticals; e.g. levo-methamphetamine and d-pseudoephedrine, but those ones are not really psychoactive so you are not going to get any of the desired effects by smoking them. And returning to your ""science project"", as others have said, only participants can take the drug, not the ones testing its effects. If you want to volunteer as a subject in any clinical trial involving a particular methamphetamine you can surely apply and if you're lucky you are gonna get to use the drug, but I still find unlikely that they will let you smoke crystals of methamphetamine hydrochloride, as other routes of administration are far more likely (for example orally or intravenously).

If your average joe were to throw a punch at him, would his hand slow down because it’s attempting to travel a solar systems worth of distance over the distance of 1 inch? \n\n4. Adding on to the previous question, say joe were to close that distance halfway before the man compressed distance around him. Would Joe’s hand be ripped to shreds because his hand is not being enough to travel that distance? Or would Joe’s hand be ripped off his arm and crushed into a small space?

"My lab was not the most smelly lab in the world. We did not make any iffy 'fine' organic synthesis. Just a bunch of chemicals, and nothing really exotic.\n\nWe had piperidine, and tetrahydropyrimidine, both smelled somewhere on the bad side of the spectrum. Can't speak much about thiophenol - it was contained safely in a well-corked vial with several layers of polyetylene zip-bags, inside a glass bottle, and all in the fridge at +3 celsius. Whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soon.\n\nOxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell - methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-isobutyl ketone, 2-hexanone (methyl-butyl ketone). Furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane (however the last one is borderline pleasant). Monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and bad.\n\nDimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted (somewhat 0.1% mass in propane). Dibuthylsulphide, on another hand, we had as a pure substance - and it is not pleasant at all, just believe me.\n\nBut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct (or, rather, residue). A greedy client hired us to determine what good - if any - contain his residues. It were residuals from olefine production, and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly. He basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit. Lighter products contained mostly butadienes (from which the 1,2-butadiene was the major one, defying thermodynamics), and the rest was a cocktail from hell - butyne-1, butyne-2, vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization. (I learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization - but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion. Thankfully, we did not learned that from first-hand experience!). \n\nHeavier fraction was not any better. We analyzed it with the method ASTM D 6730 (with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable, bad-looking, skunk-smelling devil mixtures). Oh dear. The majority, turns out, was styrene - upto 30%, and it by itself is not the best thing to work - not only it smells horribly, it also may be referred as a liquified cancer.  The rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation, partially polymerized, partially oxidated, and believe me, the entire chromatogram was something to see - and to stick labels to various peaks. The test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds - we found them all (discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table), but we also had several dozens which we can't stick a label to. I still believe there were some compounds still unknown to humanity.",Chemistry

"IMO-->  Empathy is a multi-faceted problem.  I would relate it to the kind of computational power required to simulate our universe, with all of it's constantly changing and simultaneously interacting variables.  The more accurately you can create someone else's world in your mind, the deeper your empathetic understanding will be.  It would also require simulating any emotional feelings, separate from standard inputs like sight, sound, touch, taste, temperature, etc.  All environmental variables would need to be simultaneously processed, respective to their constant changes.  Empathy requires the kind of math quantum computers were built for.  Most of the same kinds of mental skills would be required when imagining a complex mechanical device in action, with all of it's moving parts, friction heat, outside influences, and any other variables.  For the same reasons it would also apply to complex chemical reactions or visualizing complex physics.  Or you can imagine choosing the most efficient route for a package in a large shipping company, with all of it's ever moving planes, trains, trucks, personnel, etc.  The variables are constantly changing, therefore, the package's route is ever changing.\nThis would be different, however, than someone who memorized fixed mathematical rules to solve a complex linear or singular type equation.  Therefore, if a multi-faceted intelligence is valued over a more focused linear type intelligence, then yes, it would require more intelligence to produce higher quality empathetic understandings.

"Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor or researcher, and I haven't read anything about ibuprofen vs. COVID vaccines, but I'll take a stab at it:\n\nInflammation (aches, soreness) is part of the human body's immune response to infection or vaccines. Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory, and thus might work to lessen the inflammation triggered by the vaccine (maybe, I dunno for sure).\n\nIbuprofen wears off fairly quick, so any anti-inflammatory action should be short-lived. Ideally. But taking more ibuprofen is something to be wary of. \n\nDid you completely negate the vaccine with one dose of ibuprofen? Unlikely (but I don't know for sure). The immune response consists of more than just inflammation (white blood cell recruitment, memory-cell generation) that takes a while to generate maximum protection (two weeks for full effect). My **guess** is taking ibuprofen for one out of fourteen days wouldn't make much difference. \n\nIf someone wants to correct me, and/or link to studies of vaccines and ibuprofen, please feel free.",Biology

It’s especially pronounced in gasses and fluids since their molecules aren’t stuck together like solids.\n\nWe can express this as the ideal gas law\n\n(Pressure) x (Volume of container) = (amount of gas) x (Conversion ratio) x (Temperature). \n\nSince the amount of air isn’t changing, and the volume of container isn’t either, change to temperature has a directly proportional effect on the pressure of the bottle.\n\nEventually the pressure overcomes the weight of the lid, and latch.\n\nIt then equalizes pressure, gas leaves the system, and the lid falls, closing.\n\nActually similar to how the coolant in your car engine gets distributed. There is a flow regulator they call a thermostat that as it gets warmer it expands and lets through more coolant starting at some designated temp. If it gets cool it provides less coolant.

"Any virus will be under selection for higher transmissibility / infectivity. Not because of any ""want"", natural selection doesn't require desires. Most viruses have relatively high mutation rates, and while the vast majority of these mutations will be harmful to viral replication, some may improve transmission. Thanks to high replication rates in hosts (ofther factors being equal), any variants with higher transmissibility will quickly come to dominate the viral population.\n\nUntil recent decades, it was believed that viruses were under selection for *less* virulence (which FYI, means ""disease severity or lethality""), because a virus that rapidly kills or incapacitates its hosts will encounter fewer hosts to infect. For example the 1918 H1N1 influenza was remarkable for being rapidly lethal in susceptible hosts, with some infected with severe disease going from asymptomatic to dead in under a day. This actually hindered its spread, as the infected had only a very brief window of time to spread the disease. It perhaps should come as no surprise that modern relatives of H1N1 are far less virulent.\n\nHowever, there are some important exceptions. If a virus is normally transmitted in a pre-symptomatic stage of infection, there will be little selection for less virulence. For transmission, it wont matter much if all infected drop dead if there are many days in which hosts are infections and in contact with others.\n\nAnd if a virus relies on the same mechanism for both transmissibility and virulence, then the positive selection for transmissibility can entail some selection for higher virulence. For example, the binding affinity of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein for host ACE receptors has effects both on lowering the effective infectious dose / inoculum (thus increasing  transmissibility), as well as increasing the rate of viral replication within hosts, plausibly leading to viral replication outpacing host immune response. The Delta variant has nearly doubled transmissibility compared to wild type, and somewhat higher virulence in some host age groups. Here, its possible that the expected selection for higher transmissibility is also bringing some selection for higher virulence.",Biology

"Disease is a big factor. New strains of viruses and bacteria appear (or change in frequency) every year, making pathogen-resistance alleles come and go as well, almost like yearly fashion trends.\n\nThere are planktonic animals that make resting stages (e.g. eggs) that sink to the bottom of the pond and can stay in suspended animations for several years. In [one classic study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06291), old resting stages of *Daphnia* (along with their pathogens) were dug out of the mud and reanimated. This is basically like using a time machine to hop back and forth and systematically cross-expose parasites and hosts from different time periods. One cool result was that the pathogens tended to be more able to infect *Daphnia* from the same year, showing that pathogens evolve to become especially good at infecting whatever genotypes are in the host population at the moment.\n\nWeather is another big factor. For species that reproduce fast, it can even change the population within a single year. There's a really cool study system of wild fruit flies in orchards in North America. The researchers working in the orchards have shown that allele frequencies change every year from spring to fall, as the weather becomes warmer and warmer, favoring genotypes that are good at living in warm conditions (the same alleles that are more common farther south, in fact). Then winter comes, and the population is ""reset"" as genotypes that are good at handling cold become favored instead. So it's easy to see how warm years and cold years would have a similar effect.",Biology

"You make some fair points, but I’m a little unsure about your main argument. \n\nAre you saying that all of the energy gained from the past 100-150 years of burning fossil fuels would have to be used to capture the CO2 in the atmosphere, and that we won’t be able to generate that much energy because we will also have to be powering society with renewables? If this isn’t what you’re saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as I’m aware, I don’t think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I don’t know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldn’t be using fossil fuels for energy. I’m not a “clean coal” or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. It’s not a fixed cost for every material. I can’t tell if I’m missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we aren’t trying to “unburn the coal.” Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isn’t coal. This can be CO2 bound to amines in aqueous amine solutions or CO2 bound to some calcium compound among other things, but I don’t think the energy required for the adsorption has to be equal to the initial energy used.",Physics

"Great question!  It does in fact take more power to maintain a constant acceleration at increasing speed.   You can manipulate basic equations around to come up with P = F x V which clearly jibes perfectly with your observation that KE is exponentially increasing with constant acceleration.   So how do you explain a rocket, is it getting free energy (or free power) from a constant thrust force?  The answer is no of course, so what’s actually happening?   At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because it’s velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.   Keep in mind we’re not doing relativity here, so from a stationary vantage point, with constant rocket acceleration you see each progressive bit of rocket exhaust coming out with a slower and slower absolute downward velocity.  It has less and less power going into it, which cancels with the rocket’s increasing power given by F x V.",Physics

"This is a bit like saying that one vector ""is positive"" and another isn't. If I have a given basis then I can say that the vector (1,1,1) has all positive coefficients, but in another basis they could easily be negative. It's a property of the representation, not the represented object.\n\nThe possible states of particle spin occupy a 2D *complex* vector space. *One* choice of basis is to take spin up to be (1,0) and spin down to be (0,1). The other spin states will then be combinations of these, some of them involving complex coefficients in general. But the same is true if you picked a basis where spin out is (1,0) and spin in is (0,1), and then wrote spin up/down in this basis. Up/down is not special (as it can't be, since physics is rotation-invariant).",Physics

"Think about the forces in play. You have a constant air resistance force applying itself horizontally to the rope. You have tension in the rope that is not constant. If we pick two points on the rope and imagine the tension we see the tension is much higher at the top as the rope is holding the mass of all the rope beneath it. If we look at a point at the bottom, the mass of rope applying tension is much less. Again, if we look at the forces applied to a single point on the rope we can see at the top the tension vector is very long in the negative direction in comparison to the horizontal force of the wind. The sum of those vectors faces almost completely down. As we continue to do so further down the rope we see the tension decreases and the ratio of that tension vector in comparison to the horizontal air force vector decreases and the total force vector points more in the direction of the horizontal force.",Physics

"In this visualization, I show the wavefront propagation of a coherent light beam (i.e., a simple laser) after passing through a holographic film, on where I previously recorded the relative information corresponding to the phase and amplitude of the object to be reproduced.\n\nPrecisely, the recorded film needs to reproduce the Fourier transform of the object up to an arbitrary phase factor.\n\nAn experimental technique for recording the hologram is interferometry; that is, a second wavefront, mutually coherent with the first and of known amplitude and phase, is added to the wavefront produced by illuminating the object we want to reconstruct. The holograms can also be entirely generated by a computer, like the ones shown here.\n\nThe standard recording material for the holographic film is a silver halide emulsion. Spatial light modulators, which are based on a LCD, can be used for creating real-time varying holograms. Finally, with the advent of nanofabrication techniques, today we can also create metasurfaces to do the task and mold optical wavefronts into almost any arbitrary profile over several wavelengths.\n\nThis technique can be used as well for displaying an arbitrary 3D object, but for a more quality reconstruction, a bit more complex setup is going to be required, for example, by performing oblique illumination on the holographic film.\n\n[The source code I implemented for propagating the wavefront and creating the holograms can be found here.](https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Diffraction-Simulations--Angular-Spectrum-Method)\n\nHappy Halloween to everyone 🎃",Physics

"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology

"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",Biology

"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology

In paramecium two (iirc) haploid micro-nuclei get exchanged and then the paramecium detach from one another, then the nuclei fuse. In that instance the fusion of the paramecium would be Plasmogamy, then, later, when they detach and the nuclei fuse that would be Karyogamy.\n\nUsually Karyogamy follows after the plasmogamy. In some instances though, like some Basidiomycota Plasmogamy and Karyogamy happen at vastly different times. First the Hypha of two individuals fuse when they meet, and then, when the conditions are right the nuclei fuse and the mushrooms form their fruiting bodies to expel their spores.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I'm not very knowledgable about Myxomycota however (or slime molds) and would recommend checking out the subreddit for that, as it does exist and the people there are very much willing to answer those questions.

There's a couple of characteristics of a good catalyst IMO.\n\nSelectivity is one. Meaning it does the desired transformation 99% of the time or more. Imagine doing a reaction an the kilotonne scale. Lower selectivity means more waste and a 1% drop there is a lot of waste.\n\nTurnover number is another. How many molecules of reactant are converted to product in a second? Catalase is the one that comes to mind as the best here.\n\nStability is the last one that I'd consider. How long can the catalyst perform before it becomes inactive? Sometimes the catalyst can be regenerated like zeolites but you still want to be able to either stay in an active state or be stable enough to regenerate from an inactive state.,Chemistry

"I think the word you're looking for is altruism, and act of compassion towards another unrelated organism with little to no regard for the risk to oneself or compensation of such an act. In humans it is evident, although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that, on a subconscious level, it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others, that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins, a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you don't know, which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals. We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parent-offspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species. The same can be said for cetaceans, which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution. Although they may not be aware, or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk (although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites, at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species), their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures (humans, seals, other whales) based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress. Again, the payoff is positive endorphins rather than, let's say, the abstract idea of ""I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine"". I'm not sure this meta study has been done, but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species, the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species, which simply means the more social an animal is, the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards non-related organisms. But again, there is a reward whether you're aware of it or not, that being positive endorphins. One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind, and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the ""selfless"" nature of putting yourself at risk for others. It's much like that episode in friends when Phoebe let's a bee sting her. I hope that attempts to answer your question.",Biology
"It's not something you can really just read up on, it's the holistic understanding of nature that you approach when you spend years studying it. It's easy for me to tell you random ""mind blowing"" physics concepts, but to internalize and understand the results of physics overall on a deep mathematical level, and to grasp how all the macroscopic phenomena you experience in the universe emerge from a very narrow set of fundamental principles and symmetries, is what gets you deep into existential crisis territory.",Physics
"Unfortunately not.\n\nThe heat is not very concentrated, which makes it less useful. That's the first problem.\n\nThe second problem is that whatever process you create to exploit that heat will end up producing more heat in the very long run, because of the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nUseful heat is quite a rare thing.\n\nIf you are interested in this question you should about thermodynamics. Especially try to read about Carnot's original understanding of the problem. Here's a hint that will no doubt get me in trouble with some people: anytime someone uses the word 'entropy' in thermodynamics you can just substitute the word 'heat'. If you do that, thermodynamics is much less difficult than it seems.",Chemistry

"We ignore counts in the detector that happen before we lower the detector into the trap, which rejects daughter betas from the periods when we are waiting and allowing UCN to decay.\n\nThe counting process is identical for short and long runs. Any counts for daughter betas would be proportional to the number of UCN in the trap, so it cancels out when we take a ratio between short and long runs.\n\nEDIT: also the cross section for daughter betas to hit the detector is reasonably small and time required to count all UCN in the trap is small relative to the neutron lifetime, so counts from daughter betas are a small fraction of counts.",Physics
"Also, when protein become denaturalized due heat for example, the hydrophobic parts usually become exposed. Unspecific enzimes called chaperones form weak bonds with such heat shoked proteins and 'massage' them into their more stable, biologically functional form.

When you burn a candle via wick - you favour really as complete burn as possible (mainly to get more flame and less sought). If you were to burn PE in the same way (aka completely, not via a wick)), you are mostly safe again.
