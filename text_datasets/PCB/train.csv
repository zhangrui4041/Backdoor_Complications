"As someone else mentioned, yeah, it's the weak interaction that's weird in this way, not neutrinos. And since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction (or a component with a weak interaction) it has very weird consequences with how particles gain mass.\n\nIn principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and they'd just add up to the physical mass that we observe. And there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the Lagrangian (the Lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff). You just write m \* psibar \* psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particle's mass. But because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side, such a term is forbidden. Peter Higgs, and others, realized the solution to this: let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be non-zero everywhere. This gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way, but also respects the left handedness of particles. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality works.\n\nWith neutrinos its even weirder, but I'm getting pretty far off point.",Physics

"> using vinegar to clean greasy ovens and microwaves\n\nIt's a mild cleaning option.  Perfect for some uses - too slow for others.\n\nThe grease in your oven is mostly food oils.  So it's a mix of triglycerides and burnt carbon deposits, not what you may think of as ""oil"".\n\nThe acetic acid in vinegar is in the neutral or non-ionic form.  Because it's neutral and almost hydrophobic, that allows it to penetrate through the grease to the substrate and then start to swell the grease layer from underneath.  Already that means you lifting the grease away from the surface. \n\nCompare that to a caustic cleaner which is trying to dissolve the grease layer from the top down, almost like sandpapering a surface.  The vinegar penetrating and lifting can allow you to mechanically scrape up chunks instead of dealing with a corrosive mess of liquid, similar to a paint stripper.\n\nDropping the pH will protonate any fatty acids and triglyerides from their ionic form into a neutral non-ionic form.  That also helps break up the grease layer. \n\nCommercial oven cleaner is often a mix of caustic soda and an organic amine penetrating chemical.  Best of both worlds, it penetrates to lift from the surface, plus its cuastic to start dissolving from the top down.\n\nDistilled white vinegar is fantastic at polishing mirrors, glass, counter tops and handrails because it doesn't leave any residue.  You wet a microfibre cloth and it will remove any finger prints.",Chemistry

With such examples as quantum beat phenomena, the quantum eraser, and certain two-photon interference phenomena, as discussed later in this book,\nit becomes necessary to think of the photon as a quantum mechanical entity whose basic physics is much deeper than the semiclassical theory plus vacuum fluctuation logic.”\nQuantum optics Scully and Zubairy page 20",Physics

"$100 per tonne would be reasonable in terms of the cost of a carbon credit (denominated in 1t). Not absurdly cheap, but apparently below the figure used for planning by some major companies, so this could be economically viable. \n\nThe problem is where the energy comes from. There are three possible answers that I can think of: \n\n1. They have just ignored this problem. Sounds stupid, but I have come across a company with a different technology who just thought that they had to improve their tech and put in more energy scavenging to break even.\n\n2. They are only reconstituting carbon, whereas most fossil fuels are hydrocarbon. It could be that they are banking on the extra energy from the hydrogen part of the combustion. Unlikely, because the Carnot limit would probably still leave a power plant operating at a loss. \n\n3.  This is not aimed at power plants, but at things like cement factories which also produce CO2. In which case they may assume that the power is produced externally (nuclear or renewable) and that this is a way to mitigate CO2\nproduction which would happen anyway.

If we observe the photons, then only go through one slit and we don’t really see a defraction grating but if we leave the system unobserved we see the wave/particle duality.

"Also non-physicist here.  From what little I can understand about this phenomenon (time asymmetry), it's like when neutrino and muon neutrino (or was it electron and muon, or even other particles, I cannot remember the exact details) can transform to one another but it takes X time to transform from one to the other while it takes Y time to transform the other way.  Then reversing the time,  you find that the transformation time is swapped.\n\nMore concretely, let A to B transformation takes X time but B to A transformation takes Y time when played forward in time.  Now, if you see a recording and find that B changes to A in X time, you know that recording is played backward in time.  You have just broken time-symmetry since you can determine if the recording is played forward or backward in time. \n\nOf course, as others mentioned.  The overall system has to preserve CPT-symmetry.  In this case, when playing it backward in time, you do not reverse either the charge (C) or the parity (P).",Physics

They are both singlet states of the weak interaction and both are observable only indirectly, so it is very difficult to say.  Some people presume it to be true, but there is no real evidence either way.",Physics
"So far people commenting are forgetting about *length contraction*: If I'm moving at relativistic speeds, in my reference frame the distance between where I start and where I end up shrinks. Time is still passing for me, but the distance I travel approaches zero as I get closer to the speed of light. At the speed of light, then, the distance *is* zero. Better, points at lightlike separation are a distance zero from each other in the Minkowski metric.\n\nThe implication that confuses the OP, then, is that this means that, in the reference frame of a photon, it exists for only an instant: It is instantaneously transmitted from its origin to its destination, and thus in its frame *no time passes*. In our frame of course it takes time for the light to move, because light doesn't move infinitely fast and the distance between its origin and its destination *isn't* zero. In the photon's frame that distance *is* zero. This is indeed strange, for it says that a photon ""sees"" the universe as flat, with all distances parallel to its direction of travel shrunk to zero; and as far as the photon is concerned it seems not to exist for any time at all.\n\nTo that all I can say is that photons aren't people; they seem to get along with their weird lives with little worry. I don't exactly want to make the excuse that I'm a physicist and not a philosopher, since understanding the ontology is important for the physics, but it is true that special relativity works.

"It's not a stupid question, just perhaps an uncomfortable one to consider.\n\nThe answer boils down to ""yes, but..."". Just as we have bred various animals for specific tasks, we could hypothetically breed ourselves for increased strength and durability, or for some other goal. If we can turn wild steppe horses into massive Clydesdales and speedy Arabians, or take grey wolves and turn them into mastiffs and chihuahuas, we can certainly do similar things to ourselves.\n\nThe thing is, though, such changes come with trade-offs. A growing body only has so many resources at its disposal, and sinking those resources into one organ or function takes them away from somewhere else. We humans dump a lot of resources into our huge brains, for example, at the cost of a lot of other things compared to other animals; it's just that our brains provide such a massive advantage that it's worth it.\n\nAnother thing to consider: I think it's in the final episode, but at some point Nolan tells Mark that Viltrumite genetics are so pure that Mark's basically fully-Viltrumite; Mark only inherited a few superficial genes from his human mother. That's not how things work; to a biologist, ""genetically pure"" actually means ""*super* inbred"". \n\nA lot of domestic animal breeds have health problems, especially pure-breds. Not only are pure-breds usually very inbred, but if they've been bred for specific purposes, they tend to be very good at that but worse at other things. If we started breeding humans specifically for strength and durability, or speed, or intelligence, or *whatever*, you're automatically limiting your potential gene-pool, and humans already have quite low genetic diversity compared to other species. Your super-strong humans are probably going to start developing other problems within a few generations, like heart defects or being more prone to cancer. Maybe your super man will be as swole as a gorilla, but he's going to look like a Hapsburg.",Biology

"A nit is a candela per square metre, so it doesn’t really matter about the size of the display. \n\nDistance also doesn’t matter, since the candela is based on the intensity of light per steradian, which only happens at a set standard distance anyway. \n\n(A steradian is a solid angle around a sphere, when the area of the surface produced by the solid angle = r², similar to how a radian is the angle when the length of a line = r around a circle)\n\nEdit: ignore my bit about steradian, I’m doubting myself now.\n\nEdit2: don’t ignore it. However, to explain further. \n\nBecause it’s a constant angle, the amount of light contained within that cone is constant, so if you’re really far away from the source, the surface containing all that light is super spread out. At every individual point, the intensity is indeed lower due to 1/r² laws, and your eyes aren’t big enough to catch all that light, but in the entire steradian, the amount of light remains constant, hence the intensity per steradian, is constant.",Physics

The ""spazzing out"" that you're prob referring to and describing is most likely v-fib (ventricular fibrillation). *True* cardiac arrest may also be described as EMD (Electromechanical Dissociation) or even PEA (Pulseless Electrical Activity). \n\nWe have seen many patients admitted with COVID who have developed DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis), for example, of which may be so severe in lower extremities that a clot breaks free and results in a pulmonary embolism... which will result in, yes, cardiac arrest... and kill you very dead, very quickly. I've worked on these patients emergently many times prior to and since COVID began and some we've been able to help, others we haven't. A PE from a DVT, if large enough, can end up being a quick death... unfortunately... and usually it won't even matter if it happens to a patient while they are in the hospital or not.

"It depends on the type of edit but certain ones will leave a signature that could be found if you knew what to look for while others would be nearly impossible to identify. Certain correction mutations would leave almost no trace such as correcting a single misspelling that causes a disease. Standard sequencing wouldn't be able to catch that. \n\nHowever more complex edits can be more easily seen. For example if someone were using CRISPR-Cas to express a novel gene product in human it would. There the fact that the new gene is where it shouldn't be that can tell you. Additionally it would be surrounded by genetic neighbors that would help turn it on. Some of the popular helping neighbor genetic element(promoters, enhancers, ext)) don't come from humans. For example one of the most popular promoters is a viral one, not a human one. So you could search the person's genome for constructs commonly used by biologists.

"So the glucose we get from gluconeogenesis and eating food will be exactly the same in structure, however the function of the glucose at any point in time might differ to suit the body’s current needs. Gluconeogenesis only occurs when you are low on fuel. (Hungry)\n\nIf hungry —> glucose is broken down for energy\n\nIf not hungry —> glucose is converted to fuel-storage molecules.\n\n\nEXPLANATION: \n\nWhen you eat a meal but are not starving, your body is not short of energy, so the food you eat won’t be broken down to produce energy as it would basically be wasted (it’s more complicated but is sufficient to explain my point). Instead, the body converts the glucose into fuel-storage molecules such as glycogen and fat to give the body an emergency fuel source.\n\nHowever, when you are starving, your body is low on glucose. The body needs to maintain a steady glucose concentration for survival, so it produces glucose by gluconeogenesis. This glucose has a different function than the glucose we ingest because in this case, we are starving and need fuel to survive. So instead, the glucose is broken down to produce energy for the body.",Biology

"As *Homo sapiens*, our primary evolutionary niche is being highly social pack animals with tool use.

"The main problem is how we make them. We can make an atom or two at a time in a particle accelerator of basically all the super heavies, it's how we discovered basically all of them. We can also make macroscopic quantities up to Es or Fm in high neutron flux reactors (ie the HFIR at Oak Ridge). We're limited with how far we can go there because the half lives start getting too short for neutron capture to occur before the target decomposes. There ultimately isn't enough incentive to design a whole new reactor to slightly increase the yields of heavier isotopes of these elements because we still most likely won't be able to push further past Fm.\n\nMost of our current synthetic chemistry starts to not work very effectively on a µg scale which is why the state of the art is pretty much limited to Bk/Cf since Es and Fm are only available on sub-µg scales. Even the recent Es paper relied on a single spectroscopy that has an exceptionally low detection limit (XAS) rather than the traditional inorganic chemistry tool of SC-XRD, which requires a single crystal, typically of 10µg or more total mass.",Chemistry

If a photon impacts a mote of dust in the atmosphere and scatters, did its wave not collapse at the moment it collided just because no one was around to see it happen? \n\nIf you shoot electrons through a double slit onto an electron detector with your eyes closed and don’t look at the results, the interference pattern will still be on the detector. Observer or no observer, the electrons still collapse onto the detector in the same way. \n\nObserving is simply the conscious recording of an interaction - it is the interaction that causes the wave to collapse, not the observation.",Physics

"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",Biology

"There’s an interesting neutron lifetime “puzzle”, where different types of experiments measure different values for the lifetime. Bottle experiments (like this one, which measure neutrons that **do not** decay) measure a lifetime about 10 s less than beam experiments (which measure neutrons that **do** decay). This could be due to experimental error, or a 1% branching ratio to some exotic decay channel. This result doesn’t help resolve this puzzle.\n\nImproved precision helps probe CKM unitarity. Also, the neutron lifetime is an important parameter in Big Bang nucleosynthesis because it determines the ratio of protons to neutrons prior to the beginning of formation of heavier nuclei.\n\nThe neutron source is rad hot. We use a 800 MeV proton beam to produce spallation neutrons, and then cool them to UCN energy levels. Solid D2 is used in the final step to downscatter cold neutrons to ultracold neutrons.

"What I got from this it will technically work but the fillers might cause problem to health. Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\n\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\n\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\n\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\n\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection",Biology

"Part answer to your question: there's so much chemistry we don't know of the first 92 elements. Elements which are actually pretty stable, can be made and quantified and studied far more easily.\n\nThe biggest issue with heavy elements is radioactivity and rarity. Rarity makes them expensive. Radioactivity makes them difficult to use from a chemistry perspective. If you make an Es complex, it will only stay an Es complex for as long as the isotope exists. When that's on the order of seconds, microseconds etc, it's basically impossible to isolate it as a compound.\n\nIf you cannot isolate it as a compound, it's difficult to study.\n\nAnd there's the more practical reason, if you cannot isolate it, can you really call it a ""useful"" product.\n\nThinking of the economics of chemistry, what industrial process wants to use a very rare, very expensive element that decays over a matter of seconds in their chemical process.\n\nSo the applications aren't there, so the funding isn't there, so chemists don't study it.\n\nPhysicists on the other hand love heavy elements, because they care about fundamental processes.

"It’s unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didn’t even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earth’s temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. I’m not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely weren’t able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldn’t have replaced oil. It also wasn’t merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you don’t make a compelling case for why we shouldn’t try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.",Physics

"I recommend you look at a Masters by research or PhD in chemical engineering.  Note: different to Masters by coursework.\n\nMany of those ChemE researchers will be working on developing new molecules and uses for those molecules.

Each professor will have their own website with current projects.  See if any interest you and e-mail the person with your resume to ask if they have any current opportunities.\n\nA transition to straight chemistry research won't be easy.  You don't have the pre-requisite classes.  You won't be competitive against actual degree chemists.  Your practical industry experience won't be relevant to most professors.  IMHO most ChemE who move into the chemistry world will take the route of materials or polymers - which I think is quite fun and can be synthesis heavy.\n\nYou need to check with individual programs for the limits since last study.

"For me, biology was a lot of memorization in the first 5 classes or so, and chemistry was much more “learn a set of skills” and problem solve with them.\n\nNot sure why some people are telling you chemistry isn’t.  If you genuinely like and are good at chemistry, you memorize a few things and then problem solve the rest.  Look into organic chemistry.  It’s very puzzle-like.  I took like 70 hours of chemistry as an undergrad- it’s far more applied than memorization.\n\nGranted, I’m now transitioning over to computational chemistry after doing an organic chemistry PhD and 4 years of medicinal chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, so take that with whatever grain of salt you want.\n\nThe one thing I’ll say is that unlike in school, where you’re applying known things to answer questions, chemistry bench research is far slower.  It’s much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, it’s much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out it’s not working to figuring out why it’s not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, there’s almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesn’t work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.  This is not true in chemistry research.\n\nHowever, in undergrad, it is if you understand chemistry.  There’s no feedback loop- you just use the rules you learned to approach and solve the problem they give you.\n\nEither way, good luck!",Chemistry

"First: There is a difference between ""natural occurring nuclides"" and ""primordial nuclides"". Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years. Which is still a lot more stable than their respective neighbors with half lives of some seconds. \nThe hunt is not over though!

One of the other PhDs in my group did his master in the MPI on the other side of the road.

From my experience that’s often not the same person in the bigger institutes. So it’s good to make sure you can work with both of them.

"**[Chemophobia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia)** \n \n >Chemophobia (or chemphobia or chemonoia) is an aversion to or prejudice against chemicals or chemistry. The phenomenon has been ascribed both to a reasonable concern over the potential adverse effects of synthetic chemicals, and to an irrational fear of these substances because of misconceptions about their potential for harm, particularly the possibility of certain exposures to some synthetic chemicals elevating an individual's risk of cancer.\n \n**[Appeal to nature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature)** \n \n >An appeal to nature is an argument or rhetorical tactic in which it is proposed that ""a thing is good because it is 'natural', or bad because it is 'unnatural'"". It is generally considered to be a bad argument because the implicit (unstated) primary premise ""What is natural is good"" is typically irrelevant, having no cogent meaning in practice, or is an opinion instead of a fact. In some philosophical frameworks where natural and good are clearly defined within a specific context, the appeal to nature might be valid and cogent.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",Chemistry

Very dependent on the enzyme but im gonna say not exactly.\n\nYou gotta understand theres a lot more than a single nano particle and that theres a lottttttt more than single strands of DNA in a nanoparticle.

Add in the fact that theres varying binding specificity and your enzyme you pick will matter. Some are super specific and wont bind if theres a change while others will bind to anything resembling DNA.\n\nTo have enough radiation to confidentally effect every bit of DNA in a nanoparticle youll also be messing up the tissue that its in.

A crank asking for the data is just useless noise and a distraction and, for that matter, so is this discussion.\n\nIf some rule forces scientists to deal with cranks without advancing the actual discovery of scientific truth, the rule is in this case not a positive one. The net contribution of Hirsch to the study of superconductivity is *negative.* A rule which allows him to badger any experimentalist in the field is a bad one.\n\nThis is independent of whether Dias completely made up his results or not: Hirsch is not going to provide any insight into that, and it's not possible for us to decide it either. It's going to be other actual experimentalists working with materials like this who will either succeed or fail to reproduce the behavior.\n\n> . I’d be much more convinced about CSH if they’d refute the issues he brought up instead of ignore them. They’ve been accused of the highest crime in academia, prove Hirsch wrong and sink him forever.\n\nThis is silly. It's not going to happen. Hirsch is not making any recognizable scientific claim: he's just saying ""fraud, they are jerks, I don't believe it, I think BCS is full of crap, blah, blah, blah"". You can't just say the right magic words and stun Hirsch into silence with the power of data. \n\nAnd you can't ""sink him"": I think his reputation is probably as low as can be in the actual community of active researchers. But there are channels like arxiv and non-peer-reviewed journals and r/physics where even cranks get heard.\n\nScience doesn't happen like a superhero flick where Galileo goes to the Pope and mutters ""eppur si muove"" and by the end of the movie scientific truth has triumphed and the Pope has to slink off, defeated.

"The answer to that is kind of complicated, I’m no expert but I’ll do my best to explain. A ceramic is pretty much a 3-dimensional matrix material arranged in a graphitic-type structure. It is generally made of silica and/or carbon mostly but there are plenty of other things that could be inside - mostly inorganic stuff like metals. They have characteristics like no glass transition temperature (which can kind of be thought of as a melting temperature in a layman sense), brittleness (because the chemical structure is highly croslinked and there arent many ways for the molecule to move and deflect energy, so it will simply break instead), heat resistance, and chemical/corrosion resistance. Ceramics can be made in many different ways, but my favorite type of ceramics are polymer-derived ceramics. In this method, you can take a silica based polymer and you basically just heat it up. At first the polymer crosslinks into a 3d shape, locking the shape in place. Then it pyrolyzes, where the less stable molecular structures are broken apart and volatilize out of the material. At high temperatures (like 1300 C) the bonds between the atoms are breaking chaotically and rearranging, and you end up with these carbon-rich domains which are basically graphite (this process is called graphitization) and silica rich domains. There are ways you can control the morphology to dramatically improve certain mechanical properties, but that gets into some complicated stuff.\n\nOh, and Ill add that a cool thing about polymer derived ceramics is that you can 3d print them, which is SUPER valuable for making intricate geometries like rocket engine components.",Chemistry

"Method development.\n\nYou want to determine the limits of your titration.  That will be the Limit of Detection (LOD) which is the smallest amount of acetic acid you can detect.\n\nSecond is repeatability.  Take a big bottle of any type of acorbic acid at any concentration (but relevant to your experiment is best).  Homogenize it.  Split it into 10 equal or at least known masses.  Do the titration on those 10 samples and make a results table (include all results, even outliers).  Determine the standard deviation.

"As a chemistry the advice I always give in my office hours is to solve equation based problems in the reverse of how the solutions are shown in class.\n\nStart by figuring out what the question is asking for as the answer. Then start solving from an equation that has that value in it. (Early on in chemistry there will be only one or two equations that you know with the target variable, so it's a safe starting point) \n\nNext go stepwise through that equation and for each variable see if it's given to you directly by the problem. \n\nFor the remaining variables not given directly in the problem, find another equation that has that variable in it, and substitute that into the original equation.\n\nthen repeat going step twice through that new addition equation identifying which variables are given to you in the problem. Repeat for all unknown variables. If you sub in an equation and pretty much everything in it is not given to the problem try a different equation.\n\nI recommend not putting any numbers in until the very end. Keep the whole thing as an alphabet soup. You'll get lots of partial credit that way even if you mess up. Then for the very last step, show each number that you sub in and solve for the value of the variable the problem is asking for. This makes it much much easier for someone grading to follow what you did.",Chemistry

"Actually, u/Adventurous_Yam_2852 is correct. Giving testosterone (T) as part of transgender transition from female to male is *very* different from giving T to adult cis males to alter voice. \n\nThe first one raises T from very low (female normal) to high (male normal), similarly to the change in puberty, while the second would be a much smaller increase (if at safe levels). So, the proper comparison with trying to lower voices of cis male adults with more T would be trying to *further* lower voices of trans men *after* their transition -- something known not to either work or be safe.\n\nGiving a large T increase to adult cis males to lower voices might work (I don't know but doubt it), but would definitely carry important long-term health risks including high cardiovascular health risks, blood pressure increase, certain types of feminization (as the body tries to rebalance by increasing estrogen), testicular atrophy and more.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

"You're interests aren't in ""physics"" they are in science fiction. You're fine to have your interests but people who understand physics grow tired of people saying these types of things because some physicist-turned-youtuber wants more views and says whatever will get him more attention. \n\n> So if there’s a whole dark sector of matter there’s chances here. \n\nNo. Physics is extraordinarily mathematical strict. There's not freedom to make up new nonsense. The usage of ""dark sector of invisible particles"" means something specific to physicists. A term like ""dark"" often means ""not interacting with light"" -- e.g. if you're not in the light you're in the dark. It's not dark in the ""black magic"" sense. ""Sector"" often refers to some subset of matter fields and their coupling to some other subset of force carrying fields and the ""group representations"" that describe their relations. A ""dark sector"" here would be described by very familiar mechanisms and math and just would be an addendum onto our normal standard model description. \n\nAn analogy to explain why people are annoyed by your comment would be putting together a puzzle. We have a lot of it figured out but there are a bunch of open chunks. We've checked all the pieces and none seem to fit. We figure we just lost them somewhere nearby. Since the table we're doing the puzzle on is a dark black Ikea table we just refer to missing pieces jokingly as ""the dark pieces."" \n\nThen somebody who watched a popsci video comes along and says ""maybe the dark pieces are our consciousnesses combining to block out each other's understanding of the puzzle.""

"Simply put, inertia is the tendency of an object to keep doing what it's doing. Newton's first law of motion is also called the law of inertia commonly said as ""an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside unbalanced force."" In classical mechanics, gravity is just another force so if the gravitational force isn't balanced out by some other force then the object will accelerate according to Newton's second law.\n\nYou can also think of inertia as related to mass. It is harder to slow down a train moving at 50 m/s than it is to slow down a ball of paper moving at 50 m/s. And an object moving 1000 km/s in deep space (i.e. away from the influence of other objects' gravity) will continue to move 1000 km/s in the same direction until something changes that. \n\nPhysicists sometimes distinguish between inertial mass and gravitational mass though experimentally they've always been measured to be the same thing. In this case, inertial mass is the mass you see in Newton's second law when written as F=ma and gravitational mass creating the gravitational potential in the equation U = -Gm/r. Inertial mass would relate a force on an object to its overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines how much gravity an object has. Though again as far as we can tell they're the same.\n\nInertia also increases without bound as you push an object closer and closer to the speed of light. In other words, it gets harder and harder to speed up an object as you push it closer and closer to the speed of light.\n\nA final note on inertia there's also rotational inertia, which is the rotational analog of mass. Something with a higher moment of inertia is both harder to start spinning and harder to stop spinning. Moment of inertia (the official name for rotational inertia) depends not only on the mass of the object but also the distribution of mass away from the axis of rotation. A simple demonstration to see this is to take a meterstick and twirl it around its center vs trying to twirl it with the same force about one end. It's a lot harder to sping around one end because the mass is on average further away from the axis of rotation.",Physics

"As I learned from Carl Sagan, we can't comprehend 4D, but we can calculate it's ""shadow."" \n\nFor example, a creature in Flat Land that can only experience 2 dimensions will not be able to comprehend a cube, BUT, it CAN comprehend the SHADOW of the cube as projected onto its 2D world. From the creature's point of view, the object is not a collection of equal sides and angles, like a cube is supposed to be, but rather, the creature sees two differently sized squares linked together (just like a drawing of a cube).  \n\nLike the creature, we cannot see or comprehend a cube in the 4th dimension, but we can comprehend its shadow as projected onto our 3D world. A tesseract, as it's called, is simply a small cube centered within a larger cube with the vertices connected. From our perspective, the cubes are not equal sizes and the connection points are not equal to the sides of the squares, but regardless of our perception, it is a perfectly equilateral object in the 4th dimension, and each face is its own cube. We know this because, in order to create a 4th dimensional cube (tesseract), you would have to take 3D cubes and seperate them equally across a brand new direction, one that does not exist in our reality (just like ""up"" and ""down"" are brand new directions that do not exist in the reality of the Flat Worlder).\n\nMy point is, a virtual reality experience of the 4th dimension would still be grounded in the 3rd, because that's all we can experience.

"Alfred Binet's intelligence scale, a prototype for the Stanford-Binet IQ test, was developed with the sole purpose of identifying French children with developmental disabilities so that they could receive extra help in school. Binet's scale assigned children a mental age based on a comparison of their skills with those of ""normally functioning"" children. Binet explicitly warned against dangerous and unsupportable extrapolation of his work, such as using his tests to peg normal children and adults on a single, linear scale of immutable intelligence. Notable American eugenicist, Henry H. Goddard, eager to catalog Americans along just such a scale, promptly ignored Binet's warnings, translated the tests into English, and pushed for their wide-spread use. \n\n[The Eugenic Origins of IQ Testing: Implications for Post-Atkins Litigation](https://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1270&context=law-review)",Biology

"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years. If someday in the deep unexplored ocean some decendant of [*Anomalocaris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris) was found, it would be the coolest thing, but it wouldn't change current evolutionary theory.",Biology

You can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds (you'd have to eat astronomical amounts). There are cases of people overdosing on bananas (potassium has radioactive isotopes). What I'm getting at is there are things you should worry about, and things you shouldn't. And this is firmly in the ""don't need to worry about"" category.\n\nMuch bigger health concerns: smoking, drinking, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise. \n\nNow this may be a totally innocent ""rabbit hole"" you've gone down. But this also very common in people who go on to develop more severe stress / anxiety about chemicals in the world around us. If you are feeling yourself becoming anxious when thinking about chemicals, please look into chemophobia and the call to nature fallacy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\n\nThis wiki article is a good place to start. \n\nNow onto your specific issue with lead:\n\nYes, lead can bio accumulate. Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",Chemistry

"I highly recommand Dehaene's work on the neural correlates of consciousness, because, as it turns out, we do know a great deal about the ""sit"" of consciousness and what it's made of.\n\n>After discussing the empirical tests able to identify what kinds of stimulus lead to conscious perception, as opposed to unconscious ones, he identifies four signatures of conscious access:\n\n> - The amplification of an early sensory signal leading it to an “ignition” of circuits in the parietal and prefrontal circuits\n> - The appearance of a slow P3 wave in an electroencephalogram, a slow massive wave throughout the parietal and prefrontal regions about 300 milliseconds after the stimulus\n> - A late and sudden burst of high frequency oscillations, gamma band power\n> - A synchronization of information exchanges across distant brain regions with oscillations in sync\n\n> All of this is referred to as “the conscious avalanche”, the widespread activation of neural activity in a network including the prefrontal and parietal regions whenever a perception makes it into consciousness.\n\n> Which leads to Dehaene’s theory of consciousness, the global neuronal workspace, a variation of Barnard Baars’ global workspace theory.  The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> …According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world. That’s because our brain has brought it into the workspace, which maintains it independently of the time and place at which we first perceived it.",Biology
"The force holding the cars up is friction. Any object traveling in a circle is accelerating towards the center of the circle, so the car is pressed into the wall (it would fly off in a straight line if the wall disappeared, and each point on the wall ahead of the car is slightly closer to the center of the circle relative to the trajectory of the car at any point, so the car is constantly pushed towards the center as it moves forward). The pressure into the wall creates static friction with the wheels (point of contact of a moving tire is stationary) which provides an upwards force against gravity. The wall is also slanted, so the wall itself provides some force upward on the car due to gravity, adding even more to the friction force.  \n\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/forces-newtons-laws/inclined-planes-friction/v/static-and-kinetic-friction-example  \n\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/centripetal-force-and-gravitation/centripetal-forces/a/what-is-centripetal-force",Physics

"Hirsch isn't looking to ""recreate the plots exactly.""\n\nAnd, in any case, doing so is not actually scientifically important. If there is fakery, recreating fake plots from fake raw data *does not actually test scientific truth.* (I will assume you include supplemental instructions along with the data, because the original manuscript is usually space constrained so it actually cannot give enough information to get from raw data to plots: that is the hand-holding I mean).\n\nIn a philosophical sense, there is always some faith you are placing in the provider of data that it is really the data that the instruments provided. You can't eliminate that. Sharing data is more a measure of truthful behavior in a social, behavioral sense.\n\nI already distinguished that in some cases like observational sciences it can allow some additional science when it is taken generally without respect to the model being tested. That is the case in LIGO: you assume they are capturing actual strain in space-time, and sharing the data is then useful because it wasn't collected with any particular model of neutron stars or even general relativity. So if you have a competing model for such objects, you can use that data to figure out an alternative idea for what produced it.\n\nBut in a case like Dias, the data, even if truly collected from the apparatus, can't generally tell you, for example, whether the compound in the apparatus was prepared as the manuscript says, or whether the temperature and external fields were as the manuscript says. There are too many assumptions made before the data is actually collected.",Physics

"It depends on the depth to which you want to dive. \n\nTo give the basic gestalt: \n\nLight enters through the air into your cornea, through the pupil and onto the retina surface of the eye. \n\nTwo types of receptors in retinal tissue, called rods and cones, sense the light and convert them into physiological electricity in the form of an action potential. \n\nThese action potentials travel through fibers that travel back to the brain via the optic nerve. \n\nDepending on the location within the eye orbit, the fibers have a different pathway to the brain. \n\nThe fibers located in the retina on the side of your nose cross over just after entering the skull, at the optic chiasm. \n\nThis allows the left side of your vision to be stored on the right side of your brain, and your right side vision to be on the left side of the brain.  (the brain has a thing for crossing over like this).\n\nFrom here, the fibers travel to the thalamus, which further divides them by where they originated in the retina. \n\nFrom the thalamus, the fibers travel to specific parts of the occipital cortex, depending on whether they originated in the superior part of retina, or the inferior part of the retina. \n\nThese fibers travel to distinct locations in the occipital cortex. \n\nThe brain processes these impulses and produces your perception of your surroundings. \n\nObviously, great amounts of time can be explaining the nuances of vision.",Biology

"I'm sure someone will write on a way cleaner way since i'm going from memory.  \nAll of them come from the 3 dimensional wave function, do note that the 3d z\^2 may also be written as 3d z\^2 - r\^2 (after all, you'll probably be solving it in spherical coordinates and later returning to cartesian coordinates). If you really want to know more specific details such as where do each wave function comes from and how to write them you'll have to look on a quantum mechanics books, the expressions can get quite extensive.   \nWith that in mind, the squares can be easilly associated with the probability densities (squared wave function), since that is what you'll be seeing the orbital plots, and with some (really large) degree of freedom of speech, try to imagine the xy, xz, zy as solutions where the variables are correlated, justifying the fact that is never purely in the x or y (and so on) axis. For the x\^2 - y\^2 think of them as a linear combination of non-correlated variables to form the general solution, thus the highest probability wont be on a region where the (x\^2 , y\^2) combination is at it's maximum but where either (x\^2 , 0) or (0, y\^2) is being maximized.   \nThe biggest problem with this analogy comes from the z\^2 - r\^2 one, here you'll need to have some revolution solids in mind, since it's quite easy to see that the density regions are separated by a 3-dimensional cone instead of a traditional cartesian axis, that's where the r\^2 may help to visualize its formation. Try plotting a surface such as z\^2 - x\^2 - y\^2 and note that the 3d z\^2 solution lies inside the cone and around it.   \nHowever, do realize, this is just an (way) overly simplified justification, you'll need to check the wavefunction solution for each case to really get a picture of whats going on behind the scene and it's now that hard to find a table of such solutions. I'm pretty sure you'll be able to check some of the formal definitions on a book such as Quantum Chemistry by Levine, they come mostly from working the Hydrogen Atom but there's plenty of nuances on its treatment and **i would not recommend taking my analogy on word alone**.",Chemistry

"This isn't the right narrative. The correct story is that there are at least two contributions to DE which sum up to the observed value. One of them comes from a generic prediction of QFTs. This term is, in fact, hard to calculate and depends on things that we can't yet probe. But it doesn't matter because there's another contribution from GR. This one is an integration constant. That is, it is a free parameter not predicted by anything. So the observed number is the number from QFT plus the number from GR. You can see that it doesn't matter what the QFT number is since you can get to any possible observed number by changing the number from GR to match.\n\nNow someone familiar with this topic knows that I have swept a big elephant under the rug. The numbers in question are a bit silly. The number from QFT seems to be something in the range of 10^120 times the measured value. So the GR number has to be 1-10^120 in the same units. Now, there's no problem with it being negative, but some physicists are surprised that these two seemingly unconnected areas of physics have two numbers that are so closely related.

You could argue that CO2 capture technology and companies are bad because they might enable fossil fuel use rather than switching over to renewables, so that the government wouldn’t pass legislation that reduced fossil fuel consumption. On a practical level, this type of argument is a reasonable concern, and I think that it’s important to keep in the public discourse around carbon capture. At the same time, direct air capture had the potential to be so valuable in terms of removing historic CO2 emissions that I don’t think we should just ignore it because of its potential to be misused. Another nice side effect of CO2 capture technology is that many of the materials useful for carbon capture are similar to materials used to capture pollutants or toxic elements both from gas streams and water, and these types of small molecule adsorbents might prove to be very good for human and environmental health.",Physics

"I think we've converged on most points.\n\nFor the last one, neutrinos have mass. This is well established at many many sigma. There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",Physics

Wouldn't it alter the results?\n\nWe can measure them, but it doesn't alter the result. Beta decay is a stochastic event. How long a neutron has existed in the past does not effect the probability that a neutron decays in the future. A free neutron that has existed for an hour has the exact same probability to undergo decay as a free neutron that has existed for a second. However, most free neutrons will never make it to that one hour mark before decaying.",Physics

"Why does it feel like I'm doing your homework?  For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms or molecules not particles.  You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against.  You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.  Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules.  Again at this point you are really talking chemistry more than biology.

Your current skills will be just so much more valuable.  90% of the time that is all I'm reading and the remainder is filler content.

The PhD experience is so huge that you can realistically omit all other job history and nobody will say anything.\n\nShould you feel you must include it or show a longer working period, a customer service job is maybe just 1-2 lines of year/location/title.  Different if are specifically targeting a job in customer service + chemical industry.  A chemical sales job I'd go 3-5 lines because working for a chemical company is relevant, especially the product, type of chemistry, size of team, your ops budget and any successes.  I do have jobs where I want to see evidence the chemist has a broad knowledge of supplier networks, but I also have jobs where I would ignore that skill.\n\nAnother aim is to remove any *negatives* from a resume.

"*All* food proteins, with the exception of gelatin from rendered animal collagen, contain *all* of the essential amino acids. \n\nWhat differs is whether their proportions match requirements for human protein synthesis. Cereal grains tend to be limited in lysine. Legumes tend to be limited in methionine. One can still get a complete essential amino acid intake by eating enough of either, but combining these as part of daily menus mean that not much additional protein intake beyond the minimums is required.\n\nSoy is notable for being the legume with the highest methionine content. It's not a huge difference. Peas are methionine limited and have a DIAAS of around 80. Soy is methionine limited and has a DIAAS around 100.

"One should keep in mind that most dark matter ""alternatives"", including this one, actually include dark matter. It says so right on the 2nd page of their paper:\n\n> Consider requirement (iii), that is, successful cosmology. In (2) we have a new d.o.f. φ [...] What should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of ϕ be? The MOND law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter. There is, however, another empirical law which concerns cosmology: the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a^(−3).\n\nIn other words, they are saying that to get the cosmology right, they need to add dark matter -- that is what they are alluding to with the ""sizable amounts of energy"". They make their φ field play this role. It's just like TeVeS, the other major relativistic MOND theory, where the scalar ""S"" field does the same thing.\n\nThe popular press likes to frame the debate as ""dark matter vs. modified gravity"", but it's really ""dark matter vs. dark matter plus modified gravity"". The hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better, at the cost of higher theoretical complexity. If you read the paper, the authors aren’t trying to do away with dark matter at all — their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstacles.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also feel like I should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is ""less elegant"" than dark matter. These days, dark matter models are not about elegance at all, they're about minimality: trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles, with the simplest possible interactions, focusing on the dumbest possible first guess. There was an era where people to make dark matter ""elegantly"" fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the Standard Model at once, but that ship has sailed because those theories didn't work. As scientists we should just follow the evidence, without theoretical prejudice. It just so happens that at the moment most of the evidence points towards dark matter.",Physics

"Technically everything is just energy oscillating through time, morphing, changing, *breathing*. When the protons of the atoms of your cell walls disintegrate the energy released will continue on, eternal and indestructible. Energy is a pool, the universe is rock that’s been thrown in, the oscillating ripples across the surface is time. Everything; you, a car horn, the moon, your phone, are just different types of ripples pulsing through the pool. They will fade and then the pool will become still. But don’t let appearances fool you; this stillness is *perfectly* disordered and chaotic. Energy will become spread out to such an extent where it is unable to interact with itself: *maximum entropy*. Eventually all of the ripples of the universe, will fade. Energy has reached its only goal: a state of maximum entropy. The pool will then become a paradox: perfectly calm yet perfectly chaotic, waiting for something new to be thrown in.",Chemistry

"Actually, u/Adventurous_Yam_2852 is correct. Giving testosterone (T) as part of transgender transition from female to male is *very* different from giving T to adult cis males to alter voice. \n\nThe first one raises T from very low (female normal) to high (male normal), similarly to the change in puberty, while the second would be a much smaller increase (if at safe levels). So, the proper comparison with trying to lower voices of cis male adults with more T would be trying to *further* lower voices of trans men *after* their transition -- something known not to either work or be safe.\n\nGiving a large T increase to adult cis males to lower voices might work (I don't know but doubt it), but would definitely carry important long-term health risks including high cardiovascular health risks, blood pressure increase, certain types of feminization (as the body tries to rebalance by increasing estrogen), testicular atrophy and more.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

"...yeah, there's two things here that other people are either saying or dancing around:\n\n1.  There's an inherent conflict of interest and moral hazard about carbon capture tech:  if these companies want/need to remain profitable, they _need_ excess atmospheric carbon to exist, so that they have a product that _does_ something.  Also, since they have a product which captures carbon, people won't need to stop polluting.  This is just kicking the can down the road and allowing a literally extremely toxic system to continue existing.\n\n2.  There's an easier way out of this, but the solution is _political_, not technological.  It's really, really not hard to imagine a society where endless increasing production is not the _necessity_ to keep the 'economy' going.  This just requires completely retooling our political & economic system, since they are essentially the same thing at the moment.  Because if you could have actual democratic decision making, not like the system we have to day which has the veneer of democracy but really only serves the powerful, then you could make decisions that have large-scale impacts on things like infrastructure/emissions/people's daily lives.  \n\nThose being said, yeah, any tech that could potentially help avert a climate disaster is good, even if it's being built just to make money.

"A second is defined in SI as a unit of ""proper time"" -- that is, whatever one is timing has to be next to the clock, such that all of the relativistic effects affect them both, and thus cancel out.\n\nIn practice, of course, we need to time events that are not in exactly the same conditions as    the standard clocks themselves. And even the standard clocks in different national laboratories are not in exactly the same gravitational potential. Therefore for realization of a practically useful time standard, such as [International Atomic Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time), the relativistic corrections are necessary. The second of International Atomic Time is defined at the gravitational potential of the mean sea level.

">I don't know that we have an urgent need for specific terminology to discuss alien life. Life outside of Earth is completely hypothetical. If we do find it, the relevant language will be invented then and there.\n\nIt is for something I plan to work on, but life outside of Earth is 100% fact, we cant argue against that.\n\n>It's true that we'd have to make up a lot of new taxonomy, though. Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\n\n>If, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet. So ""tree of life"" basically becomes a new taxonomic level above domain. Currently we have no need for such a taxonomic level, because it's a category with a single representative (Earth life).\n\nMy point is that humans dont share a common ancestor, we evolved from ourselves, but we have two forms, our ancestors (Very similar to primates, but not decended to them) and our pre ancestors ( our old form, in our old planet, we would have to scrap many things to presume How we lived and were, my hyphotesis is that we behaved like robotic psychics, we were telepaths, used the Power of our minds to do tasks and processses, constantly changing our environment. We probably didnt have emotions, didnt move, were giants, like towers, and I dont even know if we did procreate).\n\nAnd I even claim that our pre ancestor side is regenerating with time, this is why we dont look like animals anymore and became more rational.\n\n\nTaxonomy is a actually something much more complicated, in some cases, like us, you have to show the multiple Nature while maybe at the same time showing their percentages, it should be something like chemistry, where the nomenclatures are all complex and sophisticated.",Biology
Get a pHD if you want to be treated well and afford rent. Bachelors level chemists are typically treated like grunts and get paid garbage for their first several years after college.

Radioactive decay produces far more energy than required to break a bond. So even if the ultra heavy element forms a bond, when the atom decays it breaks the bond with the excess energy from the decay.\n\nI'm not by any means saying give up on a dream, but you might need to be realistic about your options here.

The paper reported sharp drops in the measured magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature for five different pressures, that were claimed to be a superior test signaling a superconducting transition. Here I present several arguments indicating that the susceptibility data published in that paper were probably fraudulent.

"> currently I’m doing maths chem and physics but do you think that’s enough to get a job that pays well?\n\nYes, but that depends on your definition of ""pays well"" and if you're willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major. I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills. Statistically speaking, big finance and big tech are where STEM majors go if they don't want to work in STEM but want to make the most money, which is why I keep mentioning those two fields.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics
"Riverlane, a spin-out company from the University of Cambridge is developing a software platform for quantum computers to unite the various quantum architectures. Today, most hardware companies are using their own distinct architecture, which means developers have to optimise applications for a single quantum hardware.

This is the exact same physical state as the football. The mass of the ball is distributed closest to the axis, so it is least likely to deviate from a spin.\n\nIf any force were to cause it to wobble, it would want to return to its its smallest moment of inertia at first, and this would be guarded by gyroscopic procession, which causes all movement parallel to the axis of rotation to occur processed 90 degrees forward along the direction of rotation. Any outside force, instead of spinning the ball, would just cause it to wobble.\n\nI hope this helps.",Physics

"Agreed on false equivalence; I am not advocating MOND, or suggesting that it's a superior alternative to fit observational evidence -  we indeed have sufficient models for this. What I am suggesting however is that the largest technical breakthroughs in a theory tend to be ""hacks"" in the sense that, without a broader framework, they stitch together potentially disparate mathematical techniques in order to parsimoniously explain observations. This *usually* does not produce a well-rounded, coherent theory with a multitude of new predictions that fits neatly into all observed models (for a converse example, see general relativity, which did this perfectly). \n\nA solution to the horizon problem which I *wouldn't* consider ""hack-ish"" is one that has some kind of underlying conceptual impetus for *why* another ad-hoc scalar quantum field is a sensible addition to our universal framework, akin to *why* space-time is a sensible view of the universe. This is admittedly phiosophical, and I am not suggesting that inflaton fields or the higgs boson are bad physics - obviously they are far from it.

This makes sense because space is not a 100% true vacuum, there are still some particles, but they are so sparse that the pressure is effectively 0.  Since space is infinitely more massive than water in the tube, it will seem like a unidirectional force and thus 'free energy', even though the system is trying just as hard to suck the sparse particles in as to push water up.

But it's still mostly the same in academic labs all over the world.  Variable.\n\n> Should I just reach out to random ~~graduate students/~~ advisors...\n\nYes, that is entirely the whole process.\n\nCreate a short resume or 1/2 page bio and e-mail potential advisors with some flattery then ask if they have any opportunities in their group.  You should ideally have looked at their personal research page and be able to answer one or two questions about what they do.  Make the e-mail very targeted as all professors get spammed with generic ""Dear sir/madam, I am a PhD student from poor place can I please work for u?""\n\nIf the professor likes you, they can point you towards resources.  Many professors are seeking talented and interested students - pulling from a random pile of unknowns is risky for them.  You may have to wait for funding to be approved or a successful grant.  There are sometimes specific funding sources to bring in international students.\n\nCost of living, well, you are still a PhD student who doesn't earn much money.

"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesn’t matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. I’m more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someone’s substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. “Economic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air” (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what I’ve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. There’s nothing saying the second law efficiency can’t be better than 5%, and also it doesn’t matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency won’t be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation “Lackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.” In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology won’t be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I don’t think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap. Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.",Physics

"Look at their Lewis structure. They only have three valence electrons. To form covalent bonds, they can only give those three electrons, each into one bond. By doing that they form three covalent bonds and get six electrons in the outer shell. They have no 'capacity' to form more, so they're the exception to the octet rule.\n\nOf course the real story gets more complicated and there's more to bonding than the octet rule. Aluminium doesn't form covalent compounds only either, but let's say even in ionic compounds it is trivalent. \n\nLike Sea\_Wind\_2705 said, it's just a simplified rule according to one theory.

Well water itself is made of 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen and gases can dissolve in water as well. Look at soda drinks it has co2 in it.

You can get water into lungs easy but not so much getting it out…and in order to take another breathe you need to get it out so you drown because you can’t keep up with the demand.

"Well if you are getting 1000 ppm O2 within a minute, you either have a fairly big leak or your O2 sensor has gone bad. Or both. The classic test for the sensor is to open up some diethylzinc in the box and see if it smokes (indicating O2 > \~10 ppm). I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire). You could maybe do a ketyl test if you have the reagents. If you have a spare O2 sensor, I would go ahead and replace the current one and see what happens.\n\nA few questions: did you turn off the gas circulation before opening the MeI, and did you purge thoroughly after it was re-sealed? MeI is going to absolutely wreck the box catalyst if you are not careful. The O2 sensor may also be sensitive to MeI - those sensors typically have a lifetime of 6 months - 2 years, but they have somewhat sensitive surfaces that can be poisoned by exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nFinal question: is the H2O also shooting up, or is it just the O2? If it is both, that points to a leak, but if it is just O2, I would suspect the sensor.",Chemistry

"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology

This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.  Fourth would be you're immune system is compromised, perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immuno-suppressant or had viral infection, like measles, which wipes out your immune memory.",Biology

"Not the same molecules I'm working with but no other functional groups present should have any interference. I found two methods for selectively protecting a phenol in the presence of a primary alcohol - one with trityl (very difficult product to isolate and low yield) and one method doing a very similar transformation protecting with ethyl carbonate, mesylating the primary OH and reacting with DEA to add the amine and deprotect in one step. Very low yield. Also tried tosylating and similar outcome. Did a reaction with PBr3 and got the primary alcohol selectively transformed but low yield and not sure if I'll have difficulty adding the amine there in the presence of a phenol. One of the major byproducts I've gotten when attempting to add amine is the elimination product to get a monosubstituted alkene so I've tried using different bases to deprotonate the DEA but doesn't seem to be helping. Maybe the DEA would be reactive enough on its own without additional base to promote substitution instead of elimination? Not sure.",Chemistry

"As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved. You might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a PTFE stirbar on a hotplate. In the plant, it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer. All of the changes you make to scale up- more powerful mixers, bigger pumps, larger diameter pipes and hoses, can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale. A big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact, particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets, has the potential to leach into your product, or catalyze degradation, or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab.",Chemistry

"I agree with most of what you said up there, though the effects of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere and the temperature of the planet were known as early as the second decade of the 20th century. And, yes, hydrocarbons have been awesome for rocketing humanity into the 21st century. But we aren't changing today. We know. We know what is happening to our planet, the science is solid and incontrovertible. And yet, our carbon production is growing every year. This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there. I wonder sometimes if articles like this aren't mostly posted by the paid corporate trolls of the carbon producing energy companies.

"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",Biology

"""Why"" is kind of a trap when talking about evolutionary biology. Things gain and lose not just based on what sees them through to reproduce, but also for no reason at all. Why did humans develop different colored irises? There's an argument to be made for sexual preference of mates, but it doesn't offer any direct benefit for survival necessarily besides absorbing different amounts of light. I have very light blue eyes and I'm miserable in the sun, but I can have a kid just fine and pass on that trait. If blue eyed people were so inhibited by their blue eyes, we'd die out before we were able to reproduce, but it's just one of those things that has a negligible impact on reproduction.\n\nSo, why do soybeans have more proteins? A bean at one point in time developed a mutation in their DNA and they generate more amino acids and it didn't inhibit their ability to reproduce, or maybe it actually improved their ability to reproduce or adapt to environments, and that's probably cutting edge soybeanology, might be a good topic for a paper.

"I have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system. I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end.",Physics

"I found this on the World Wide Web:\n\nNo shape can “amplify” sound.\n\nSound being a pressure wave in air, it has a fixed energy, which dissipates with distance from the source.\n\nIf you want to maximise the amount of that energy you capture, a parabolic dish can focus that energy down to a point, which has the effect of concentrating it there. The bigger the dish, the more energy it can redirect.\n\nIn reverse, a parabolic reflector can also create a “beam” of sound from a point source. This is not amplification, but it does optimise the energy that is there in a particular direction.\n\nAnother aspect is the efficiency of acoustic coupling. A vibrating membrane might have a certain power, but if it’s coupled poorly to the air, it won’t produce much sound. Certain shapes can vastly improve this efficiency. It does not “amplify”, but it does make sure that what energy is there is transferred to the air efficiently. This is the purpose of horns such as on acoustic gramophone players, brass musical instruments, PA speakers, etc. The best shape is an exponential horn that forms a smooth impedance match between the original source of vibration and the air. Horns work either way around - as a receiver, the human ear is somewhat like a horn; many animals have very obviously horn-shaped ears which acts as a combined horn + parabolic reflector.\n\nby Graham Cox, BSc (hons) from University of East Anglia (1993)",Physics

"Here’s a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \n\n““>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. “\n\n[End of your quote. If you don’t feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there’s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I’ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don’t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I’ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I’m saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It’s one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you’re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I’ve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n“>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.”\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said “[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got” and then you tell me to “shut up” for saying that you said that “DAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.” I’m very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I’m this part where you quoted me I’m saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said “couldn’t be feasible” this was meant to be synonymous with “impossible” rather than “unfeasible,” then either you’ve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I’m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",Physics

"Okay so this is a tough question, let me try to bring some light to it.\nSo, the issue here lies with the interpretation on Quantum Mechanics. QM postulates describe how do systems work. They are true (as far as we know), but they don't give a further explanation as to why is the world like this. These postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system. The measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement. And the instants before and after the measurement, the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour. However, what does it mean to perform a measurement? The measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude (it could be energy, speed, position... of the system). Usually, we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements, since, in the limit, they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equations(if they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument we'll toss it under the carpet). So, in these cases, even if there's no evident observer, there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems. \nThis means that you don't need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunction.\n\nHowever, if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function, one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isn't collapsed. Then, you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave. What happens with all the other possible discarded states (universes in this case) is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qm.\n\nTL;DR: we don't need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions, the universe is and will be a quantum state\n\nHope it was useful:)",Physics

"See [here (especially citations 10–12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion#Axion_dark_matter) and [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion#Cosmological_implications) They are their own antiparticle, so when their field ripples, two of them get made at once (instead of a particle-antiparticle pair). During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.) Hence why papers like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037026938390638X?via%3Dihub) establish _upper_ bounds on the vacuum energy of the axion field.",Physics

"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",Physics

"A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \n\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes.",Biology

And basically none of the descriptions really sink in. The problem, of course, is that it is a fundamentally QM process with no classical analog. So it's better to at least use the right words so people can connect what they're reading here with what they've read and heard elsewhere. And it's not like oscillations is a unfamiliar word.\n\nThe fact that neutrinos oscillate implies that there are almost certainly sterile neutrinos; the presence of a 1 eV sterile or not does not change that.

If the pressure difference between inside and outside is dominant, then moving the hole up or down will have little effect on the flow velocity, and the velocity will be proportional to the square root of the pressure difference.",Physics

The hexagonal thing is not the simplest unit so it's pretty easy to see why that's not the unit cell. The tetrahedron I actually only see in your description and I'm reasonably certain the reason it doesn't work is that it does not contain enough information or atoms to rebuild the crystal structure. I'm actually not really seeing a tetrahedron. The best tetrahedron I can see is not regular by any stretch of the imagination and definitely won't tesselate to rebuild an entire crystal from that unit. Did you mean octahedron to include all the face centered atoms in the cubic crystal? The issue there is that if you tesselate the object, you'll skip a bunch of atoms. \n\nThe short answer would be that very smart people have worked on this for over a century and the cube is the simplest unit cell that can be tessellated to reproduce the entire crystal structure. If you have an alternate idea for the unit cell, I guarantee your missing something.

"I think part 3 is actually the problem with that idea!\n\nThere are two parts to your adaptive immune system: The first is humoral immunity, which refers to antibody production and what we often talk about.\n\nBut the second is cellular immunity - that’s your T cells, and what they do is look for cells that are internally producing foreign proteins and literally kill them off, on the theory that producing a foreign protein is a sign of being infected.\n\nSo if we integrated spike protein DNA into our cells, the cells would then be detected up by T cells trained against the spike protein as “cells producing foreign proteins” and killed off.  It’s a good system for protecting us, but probably makes this idea not the most viable!",Biology

"Hmm.  I would submit that many if not most highly-successful models in physics are or at least started out as exactly that:  hacks, as you've defined them here.  Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today — these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics — or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people — humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension — are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.  And it seems to me that idea extends to natural law as much as it extends to the ""content"" of nature (matter, and how the world/cosmos is arranged, etc.).\n\nThoughts?  Cheers,",Physics

"If you are just responding to job postings, it's important to know that most jobs are filled before the posting ever appears. Advertisements and postings are often made because it's company policy or required by statute, as with many government jobs. \n\nI would suggest going to people you know in the business, such as the professors and even the post-docs in your former university. They may be able to put you in touch with people who can help or who might have openings available. If there's a placement service in your alma mater, talk to them, too. \n\nI'd recommend searching old posts here and in /r/labrats for job hunting advice. \n\nI've hired a lot of people during my career. It may help to know how the hiring process goes in institutions of any size, for example, a company or a national lab. \n\n1. When a position comes available, they haul out a stack of accumulated resumes or applications, starting with anywhere from 100 to 300. Someone in HR leafs through them, discarding most for real or arbitrary reasons, eg, messy, bad grammar, soaked with perfume, totally off topic, weird fonts. This is why it's important to tailor you resume to each job you apply for (not the same as lying, just making the best presentation). \n2. When the stack is whittled down to 20 or so, it's sent to the hiring authority, usually your future boss. S/he will try to whittle the stack down to 5 or 6, and arrange them in some order of priority. \n3. The top 2 or 3 will enter the interview process. In my experience, the top candidates are often already employed by the time I saw at their applications, so I work down the stack until I get a manageable number of interviewees. \n4. If no suitable candidate is available, then they advertise the job and restart the process. \n\nOther places handle it differently, reaching out to their network of colleagues to find promising students or recent graduates.

Now, the further Electromagnetic waves travel, the higher the redshift is measured with an ""infinite redshift"" at the event horizon of our observable universe. \n\nDoes that mean the wavelength of those photons approach 0 and wouldn't that also mean, that energy density decreases with time and distance , leading to the curvature of spacetime to ""flatten"", but since energy is always conserved, wouldn't that also mean that space seemingly increases?

"I‘m sure that there are other good approaches to this, but this is what I would recommend.\n\nIf by „pretty much nothing“ you really mean nothing I would say start what at an atom is and how it is built. Learn what an orbital is and all these things. From there there are some very important principles like electronegativity which will lead you towards reactivity. Then learn what a chemical bond is and why it is formed, what types of bonds there are but also rules about how many bonds which element tends to form and why / tendenc to give awy / take up electrons (noble gas configuration). If you don‘t understand these things you won‘t really understand chemistry but rather be learning facts. \n\nNow if you know all that stuff or once you‘ve learned that, start with basic things like acid-base chemistry and redox chemistry. They are very basic principles and maybe not the most interesting but as you learn more you will notice that you will encounter them quite often. And from there just see what you‘re interested in and go for that.\n\nI guess organic chemistry might be a good start to understand some stuff that happens in nature and you can go into biochemistry from there if that seems interesting to you. \nJust be aware that if you want to check out organic chemistry depending on where you learn it from there might be a ton of reactions that are nice and cool but only relevant for synthesis and not for the sort of understanding you seem to be interested in.\n\nGenerally there are some good videos starting from the very basics on youtube if that‘s something you like.",Chemistry

In all that time, hundreds of generations, no government has endured long and no government has been so successful that we've deliberately set about to duplicate it again and again. No government has even survived unchanged for long. So, even if we had a good idea of what good governance looked like, we probably couldn't count on keeping it for long.\n\nAnd you just take our largest crisis, climate change, and say, ""no problem!

"I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nIt's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)",Physics

"Industrial medicinal chemistry here, not in the US but there'll be some commonalities.\n\nYou'd start doing synthetic organic chemistry while they teach you the med chem, the chemistry is often simpler and less cutting edge than what you're probably doing for your PhD but the priority is getting the compound out for testing as fast as possible. There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data. For me, getting the data back on something you designed or made and seeing it progress through the assays is a really fun part of the job.\n\nEquipment and time-saving kit are more readily available. Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it. Industry loves new technology and will often invest in it quite heavily. More time is spent on admin and meetings than in academia, and there are far more rules and policies to follow.\n\nSalary is usually pretty good and should be much better than a PhD stipend, most companies have bonuses and stock options too. Careers development again depends on the company but large firms are usually quite good at helping you develop your career the way you want to, such as specialising in synthesis, med chem or people management.

"I am increasingly interested in the prospect of going after a PhD in Switzerland or Germany.

For the record, I am interested in Eth Zurich, schools in Germany and the UK, and am passionate about organic chemistry and multi-step synthesis. I have been in industry for a few years after obtaining my master's, however I have no publications, at least, the material may not be published for a few more years (my former advisor is slow to publish and has a record of taking 5 years after graduation to publish a work). I am curious if anyone has ever made that leap from the States to Europeans schools. I have seen a number of fantastic professors that have interesting research that I would love to apply to be a PhD student in their labs, however I am unsure of the tenability, especially in terms of pre-earmarked budget, cost of living, expenses, resident requirements, resident requirements/fees, taxes, and even covid regulations. I am also unsure of what work culture is like in Europe. I have heard hear-say that Germany and Switzerland have student unions to push back on advisors and their requirements for PhD students to work 50-80 hours a week; that the work life balance for PhD candidates is actually a lot better than in the US. That sounds like a dream and another motivating factor that makes me interested.  \n  \nHas anyone made that leap? If so, would you care to comment?

"I would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the ground-effect region, and so extremely close to the ground, that viscous drag forces enter the system as well. \n\n(No particular order)\nEffect 1: as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed, the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance, so the exit-air’s volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry. \n\nEffect 2: as the distance diminishes, the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly. \n\nCombining 1 and 2, you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit. The fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed, but this acceleration takes work. And the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plate’s downward kinetic energy. Therefore the plate slows down (at least in part) from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid. \n\nEffect 3: when the plate gap gets quite small, there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the air’s acceleration along the escape path. The air’s inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise, and the plate’s downward motion is decelerated even stronger now. Now it’s on a more pronounced “air cushion” but time is limited before it runs out. \n\nEffect 4: For very light and very large plate, there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate. It appears floating, initial downward speed is gone, but a small downward speed is still required for the air’s pressure to remain high. Now that the plate’s weight is almost balanced, the motion from here forward is now roughly constant. The plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime, where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap. \n\nEffect 5: now the plate may have had some forward momentum! Or otherwise, with the plate in the floating regime, air might realistically leave faster on one side, giving the plate a tilt. Now it “slides downhill” on this inclined air cushion. \n\nEffect 6: there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely. The plate’s slow, constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this \n\nIn all, the total combination of these effects can make falling, light, large plates stop descending, start sliding forward, and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving.",Physics

Is general intelligence simply the average of one's different types of intelligence? I feel like intelligence may be impossible to quantify with the limited information that we can gather about someone. For example, Nickola Tesla was an ""intelligent"" individual but he was also delusional and had problems forming relationships which suggests that he had a low emotional intelligence. Therefore I would say Tesla was in fact of average intelligence, even though he was a very noteworthy individual who advanced various fields of science. Perhaps intelligence can be defined by one's contributions to society, but even that leaves a lot to be desired. Can anyone recommend a book about what intelligence actually is?

Oil floats on water. Mercury sinks below water. If you filled a balloon with oil and threw it into a pool the balloon would be no different thag a helium balloon in the atmosphere. \nI think the question you’re actually asking is can a liquid float in air? Not that I know of. You can get into some weird situations like hyper dense gasses like hexaflouride. Helium 3 is the least dense liquid but I think it only exits around absolute zero and at that temp hexaflouride would probably freeze solid. If you had a frozen glass of helium 3 it would “float” on hexaflouride until the helium evaporated. \n\nUnder high pressure I would guess it’s possible a liquid metal could float on some freak gas but that’s high level chemistry.,Physics

">To address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. \n\nA slight correction to this -- the CO2 doesn't really *re-emit* the photon.  Instead the absorbed photon excites the ro-vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule, effectively increasing its kinetic energy, which is then re-distributed to other molecules (such as N2, O2, H2O) in the atmosphere upon collisions, effectively leading to increased kinetic energy content (=temperature) of the atmosphere.  This difference in the process is crucial for understanding the fine details of the greenhouse effect; however, it is almost trivial at the same time, given that the black-body radiation (mostly IR for something at \~300K) of a substance is temperature-dependent.",Physics

">I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent — after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.  Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.  It may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated ""models""/systems/frameworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a ""hacky"" or ad-hoc way from our human perspective.\n\nPlaying ""god"" for a minute, one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as ""well we slapped this idea together with these two, and then glued it all together using *this* one, and by golly would you look at that: it can sustain intelligent life! who'da thunk it?""\n\nAs much as I *abhor* the anthropic principle and consider it a non-explanation for any phenomenon in general, I'll admit it is still entirely possible (perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true) that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery. :p\n\nAnyhow, cheers and thanks for the interesting convo! :)",Physics

Since you know his mass, 77.1 kilograms, you can solve for his final velocity to determine his momentum upon hitting the ground - which is found by multiplying his mass by his final velocity. The force he experiences upon hitting the ground depends on the time it takes him to come to a full stop. That's because Johnny's change in momentum, which again is mass times velocity, is equal to the impulse he receives from the ground, which is force times time. Therefore, a more drawn out or cushioned impact results in a smaller force.",Physics

"I mean, you could always make your own standard. If you're confident you have extremely high purity salt to begin with (KCl for example), you would need a very precise mass of salt and a very accurate volume/mass of 18.2 MO water (pretty common in echem labs).\n\nIt's all about how confident you are about the [Cl-] in your solution. Also about how confident you are that there isn't anything else in solution that behaves like Cl- (IIRC F- can interfere with chloride ISEs, don't quote me on that though).\n\nSo ultimately, if you can make it yourself and are confident in the purity of KCl / DI water you're using, I don't see why not. Bear in mind you'll probably have to re-make the standard (the shelf life won't be great) between experiments depending on usage.\n\nDefinitely calculate and propagate the error if you serial dilute to make a calibration curve.\n\nIMO it depends on whether you need the certifications that come with buying the standards / what kind of experiment you want to perform.",Chemistry

Even vanta black is only 99 and even a black hole isn't perfect 100 absorber.\nIf you know how light works, it's wave and particle nature  you would understand how this is very unprobable and makes little sense.\n\nThe only final way I can think of is destructive interference ,for that specific conditions have to be met ,the light source in the room should be mono chromatic.\nAnd the light source from our device has to be in opposite phase. This would allow the light from our torch to under go destructive interfernces. And make the specific point dark. But this is a very difficult and highly improbable scenerio considering phase of light can change with path difference and even the air inside the room can contribute to a difference which would mean we won't get a 100 percent result.",Physics

"You're just wrong. Yes, the excited vibrational modes can increase the kinetic energy of other molecules in the atmosphere, but CO2 definitely re-emits photons after the initial IR absorption. As with some of your thermodynamics arguments above, it seems like you know enough about some of these things to think that you're right and be able to give a plausible sounding argument, but it seems like you just lack some basic ideas about the specifics. CO2 really does re-emit the photon. Here's a simple link that explains this [fact](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/how-climate-works/carbon-dioxide-absorbs-and-re-emits-infrared-radiation#:~:text=Molecules%20of%20carbon%20dioxide%20\(CO,from%20infrared%20\(IR\)%20radiation.&text=The%20energy%20from%20the%20photon,by%20emitting%20another%20infrared%20photon.). Here's another [source](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/02/25/carbon-dioxide-cause-global-warming/). Beyond these very high level qualitative explanations that re-emission happens, you can also look at a physical chemistry textbook or a solid state physics textbook for a discussion of the interaction between photons and vibrational modes. Madelung's solid state physics book, for example calculates the rate of IR absorption, and you can calculate emission in an analogous way. His book might even do that derivation too, but I don't remember if it does since I read that section a while ago.",Physics

Both nymphs and adults are generalist predators that feed on a variety of insects including aphids, caterpillars, bugs, beetles, and more. The bug uses its stout beak to inject the prey insect with a toxin that kills it within 30 seconds. Most of their prey are pest insects so they are considered beneficial to farmers and gardeners. They move slowly and are clumsy fliers. Their bite has been described as being more painful than a wasp sting so they should be admired but not handled\n\nRead more at: https://growingsmallfarms.ces.ncsu.edu/2020/04/birth-assassin-bug/",Biology

"Hey man, second year Uni student here. From what I've been told, a Biochemistry major is better than general chemistry major in terms of job prospects because it gives you both biology and chemistry, but you'll likely end up working in a career thats more biology-oriented. If you're more interested in Chemistry and that's what you want to pursue, I think a pure Chemistry major would be better for you.\n\nKeep in mind, you will probably have difficulty with finding a chemistry-related job right out of your undergrad with either of these majors, as both of these fields are quite popular and  professional work usually requires a masters education or higher.\n\nDon't let that discourage you though! Usually, the only people who get high-paying jobs right out of their undergrad are Engineers and CompSci/Tech students. If Chemistry is your passion, ride the wave. There aren't as many people these days going into just pure chemistry as there are in chem engineering, biochem, or other applications.\n\nIt's a difficult major, but if you stick it out and commit to learning instead of faking your way through school, you will definitely be able to get a good job.

Liquid wax is rising up from the surface into the wick to replace the wax being burned.

Those currents carry some of the small particles with it, which make the current visible. The changes in speed are neat. The current clearly gets compressed and therefore speeds up on the surface, but spreads out and slows down just below.",Physics

"Short answer stick to cs and there are plenty of cs jobs in healthcare, unless you specifically want to go MD. \n\nChemistry or especiallh biology is, unfortunately still largely a black box and there's little logic behind any of them. There are, but ask around and most research got the result first then try to explain the logic behind it. The most math intensive thing in benchtop chemistry or biology is deriving ratios for buffer and REPEATING it many times. On top of that bio majors produces the most amount of graduates so you will be competing with these many fuckers for these kind of jobs. \n\n\nThe most mathy Chem class is, of course physical chem and unfortunately it's not there to guide chemical reaction designs yet. It's close I would assume but not there. People would rather swing up a round bottom flask in one hour than computationally investigate a reaction for two days. There's no doubt in silico drug design is a thing but it's not typically something you touch in undergrad, for reference my undergrad at gatech back in 2014 spent one semester of pchem in a 200 ppl class of quant Chem which I can safely say as someone got an A with 60% exam scores, nobody got what the heck was going on. Another semester is wasted in thermodynamics which became absolutely useless. \n\nBiology is even worse in terms of memorization. Ive done 300 level biochemistry and had became a ta in that course involuntarily in grad school and it's all about memorization of stupid cycles that nobody cares. At least you'd imagine they'd teach you how that cycle is logically discovered, but fuck no.\n\nAlso be warned a typical Chem or bio graduate has nothing to do with healthcare. The closest healthcare job you can get with a chem bs is some guy running hplc in hospitals, and for biology I can't see any. If you like drugs that much, at least try computational drug design. Synthetic chem is arguably an easy way to get into drug design but I don't see it fitting you at all, just find the synthetic Chem labs in your school and talk to the grad kids what they do. Buy them a lunch and they will tell you their childhood secrets along with it, it works just that wonderfully.",Chemistry

Very dependent on the enzyme but im gonna say not exactly.\n\nYou gotta understand theres a lot more than a single nano particle and that theres a lottttttt more than single strands of DNA in a nanoparticle. If you shine some radiation on a sample it wont homogenously effect each bit of DNA the same and many will go unscathed.\n\nAt that some modifications of DNA are going to be much more detrimental to DNA binding than others. Add in the fact that theres varying binding specificity and your enzyme you pick will matter. Some are super specific and wont bind if theres a change while others will bind to anything resembling DNA.\n\nTo have enough radiation to confidentally effect every bit of DNA in a nanoparticle youll also be messing up the tissue that its in. Proteins will also be messed up in the process for instance.\n\nIf the DNA containing lipid nanoparticles were separate from the tissue/enzyme to begin with and you treated it to a prolonged exposure to radiation before adding the nanoparticles to a culture/reaction  mix then sure tho,Biology
